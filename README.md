# ⚛️ Elemental Synthesis Lab

A realistic educational game where you merge and buy elements from the periodic table. Synthesize new elements, earn achievements based on radioactivity and atomic properties, and use elements in real-life lab experiments. Start from hydrogen and work your way through the periodic table!

## 🎮 Features

- **Element Store**: Buy real periodic table elements with realistic pricing based on rarity
- **Merge Machine**: Combine elements to create chemical compounds
- **Lab Projects**: Use synthesized elements to complete real-life lab experiments
- **Achievement System**: Unlock achievements based on:
  - Element radioactivity levels
  - Atomic number milestones
  - Synthesis difficulty
  - Element properties
- **Inventory System**: Track all elements you've collected
- **Score & Credits**: Earn rewards by completing projects and synthesizing compounds

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Start with 1000 credits in the **Element Store**
3. Buy basic elements like Hydrogen (H) and Oxygen (O)
4. Go to **Merge Machine** to combine elements
5. Use synthesized elements in **Lab Projects** to earn rewards
6. Complete projects to unlock new elements and achievements

## 📚 Game Mechanics

### Element Properties
Each element has:
- **Atomic Number**: Position in the periodic table
- **Price**: Cost to buy from the store
- **Difficulty**: How hard it is to synthesize
- **Radioactivity**: Stable or radioactive classification

### Chemical Reactions
Valid reactions include:
- **H + O → Water (H₂O)**: 150 credits reward
- **C + O → Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**: 200 credits reward
- **H + N → Ammonia (NH₃)**: 180 credits reward
- **He + He → Helium Compound**: 300 credits reward

### Lab Projects
1. **Water Lighter** - Combine H + O to create water
2. **Iron Hammer** - Synthesize Iron (Fe) compounds
3. **Golden Ring** - Create Gold (Au) products

## 🏆 Achievement Types

- **Basic Elements**: Unlocked by purchasing any element
- **Heavy Elements**: Created from elements with atomic number > 50
- **Radioactive Elements**: Special achievements for radioactive elements
- **Rare Elements**: Expensive and difficult-to-synthesize elements
